This task is about using Excel Pivot and Charts to analyse the kickstarter data set and using VBA programming to analyze real stock market data.

Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. Here we  will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

Using the Kickstarter Dataset provided we will be answering the following questions using Excel Data Analysis and Pivot
1. What conclusions we can make on the Dataset 

 2.What are the limitations of the dataset

3. Create charts and graphs which gives us the big picture.

The Analysis report is in the word document in the repository


Using the VBS dataset provided, Here we Create a script that will loop through all the stocks and take the following info.

  * Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

  * The percent change from the what it opened the year at to what it closed.

  * The total Volume of the stock

  * Ticker symbol

 *  Have conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

*  locate the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
